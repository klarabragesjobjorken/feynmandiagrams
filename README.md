This algorithm generates all possible Feynman and vacuum graphs of degree four with four external edges, without loops and cut vertices. 
The Feynman graphs can be used within quantum field theory (specifically phi four theory) and particle physics to study interactions between particles.
They can also be used within statistical mechanics to study systems in the same universality class as phi four theory.
